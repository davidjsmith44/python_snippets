# Python Snippets

This repository is intended to contain sample code from python projects done for financial risk management that will be repeated over time.

I am still determining if we need to do these snippets in a jupyter notebook or just as source code.
May need a tutorial section first as a notebook and then the source code in each of the subdirectories

For now, include a notebooks directory and add one tutorial for each. The snippets themselves will be included in the base directory

#### Directories
##### Python Fundamental Objects
- dictionaries: dictionaries are a fundamental object in python and they are used with higher level packages (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn, etc.)
 - lists: lists are a foundation for python so examples of how to use them are included here
 - strings: strings are also a foundation for python. The strings are a base part of python, but there are also string methods and functions in pandas. For now, I will include the pandas string functions in a seperate file


##### Module specific Tools
 - pandas
 - numpy
 - matplotlib
 - seaborn
 - plotly
 - dash

##### Additional information
 - git: contains notes only about how to use git (just documents here)
